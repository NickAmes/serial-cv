This folder contains software for the serial-cv converter board
(http://www.fetchmodus.org/projects/serialcv/).

The 'firmware' folder contains the firmware for the device itself.
To compile, you'll need the avr-gcc toolchain. Adjust the Makefile for your
programmer (usbtinyisp by default) and run make.

The 'programs' folder contains a simple library for controlling the
serial-cv board from a computer program (serial-cv.c/.h), a utility to
set the output voltage from a command line (setvoltage.c) and a program
drive a synthesizer's pitch CV from MIDI events (monotron.c).
The serial-cv library and the setvoltage utility should compile on any
POSIX-compliant system (such as GNU/Linux). The monotron program
requires the ALSA Sequencer and libasound, so it will only work
on Linux. Run make to build.
